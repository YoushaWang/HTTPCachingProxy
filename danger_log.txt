Danger log

1. when deal with (dmx.districtm.io,443), it will produce 
    no-id: ERROR cannot get address info for host

2. POST: it really depends, Sometimes it works good, Sometimes the POST will wait a lot of time. We suggest you can open the post page before proxy run, and use post
    We can guarantee that our post works, you can see it in our testcase.txt

3. Chunk: we have realized chunked page get, but you may need to refresh the page to get the chunked information, 
    this is because when we write the processGet function, we are not considering the chunk instead we accept only 
    content_length based page, now it is not fixed, but you still can get chunked page once you request GET the second time.

4. GET: in web browser like fire fox, it Sometimes went really slow when we want to use GET. But, if you use the following instruction in terminal,
    you may find we actually get good page:
    export http_proxy=http://localhost:12345
    wget http://httpbin.org/forms/post
    open other terminal, and you can find it works well;

5. core dumped:
    5.1 terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
        what():  basic_string::_M_construct null not valid
        Aborted (core dumped)  
        This error message is indicating that the program has encountered an unhandled exception of type std::logic_error, which was thrown 
        due to an attempt to construct a std::basic_string object with a null pointer. The error message specifically points to the _M_construct 
        function of the basic_string class, which is used to construct the string object. 
        We don't know exact reason for this, but we guess it is foxfire broswer, it will often send unknown request, which will cause a initialize 
        nullptr for std::sting

    5.2 WARNING: when get req from real server request receive failed in httpbin.org

6. Exception: 
    our proxy is basic exception guarantee. 
    Our proxy will create a client to connect the real server and server to connect to the browser. In the process of creating socket,
    if there is any failure, it will throw a error message to the terminal and terminate the process.
    If the proxy receives request more than POST, GET, CONNECT, it will return 400 error.
    If the proxy receives wrong response, it will return 502 error.
    Our Cache class has copy, assignment, destructor operation

7. External failure:
    When we refresh a web page frequently, it will fail to send response, so we suggest that use wget in different terminal to test;
